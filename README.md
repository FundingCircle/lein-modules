# lein-modules

On my continuum of hatred for all build tools,
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
are at opposite ends. This plugin is the result of my desire to
transform the
[Immutant source tree](http://github.com/immutant/immutant) from a
Maven
[multi-module project](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html)
to a Leiningen one.

I'm not done yet.

## Usage

Put `[lein-modules "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile. I doubt any of this will work with Leiningen 1.x.

## Configuration

All of the configuration for this plugin is contained in a map
associated with the key `:modules` in the project.clj of one or more
of your "parent" projects. The `:modules` map has three keys:

* `:inherited` - This is effectively a profile that will be merged
  into each project map of your "child" modules.
* `:versions` - Similar to Maven's dependency management feature, but
  **much** simpler, child modules can use keywords instead of version
  strings in their dependencies/plugins/parent vectors. Those keywords
  are associated to actual version strings in this map, allowing you
  to maintain the versions of your child modules' shared dependencies
  in a single place.
* `:dirs` - **TODO** Normally, child modules are discovered by
  searching for descendant project.clj files, but this vector can
  override that behavior by specifying exactly which directories
  contain child modules. Whether this option is specified or not,
  build order is determined by child module interdependence.

The plugin relies on the `:relative-path` attribute of the `:parent`
vector in each module's project.clj. Via implicit Leiningen
middleware, this plugin will merge the `:inherited` maps of all parent
projects, with the most immediate ancestors taking precedence.

## TODO

* Add an optional `:profiles` key in `:inherited` that indicates which
  parent profiles should be merged when the same profile is active in
  the child. Note `:profiles` and `:active-profiles` on project's
  metadata and expand any composite keys
* Have plugin put `[lein-modules "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` in the `:plugins`
  vector of `:without-profiles` metadata via middeware? Otherwise, the
  pom and jar tasks unmerge the `:default` profiles, and
  versionization doesn't occur
* Versionization of `:plugins` is potentially a bit of a chicken or
  egg problem -- plugins are loaded before middleware is applied, so
  keyword versions will disappoint pomegranate. Instead, we may need
  to introduce some subtask that spits out versionized project.clj
  files in each child dir.
