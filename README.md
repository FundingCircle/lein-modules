# lein-modules

On my continuum of hatred for all build tools,
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
are at opposite ends. This plugin is the result of my desire to
transform the
[Immutant source tree](http://github.com/immutant/immutant) from a
Maven
[multi-module project](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html)
to a Leiningen one.

I'm not done yet.

## Usage

Put `[lein-modules "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of
your `:user` profile.

Installed globally, the plugin will only affect those projects that
include a `:modules` map in their project.clj.

Still, if you'd rather not install it globally, put
`[lein-modules "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of every
associated module's project.clj.

## Configuration

This plugin relies on two keys in your project map: `:parent`,
specifically its `:relative-path` attribute, and `:modules`, a map
which may contain the following keys:

* `:inherited` - This is effectively a Leiningen profile. The implicit
  plugin middleware will merge the `:inherited` maps from all its
  ancestors, with the most immediate taking precedence, i.e. a parent
  will override a grandparent.
* `:versions` - Similar -- but **much** simpler -- to Maven's
  dependency management feature, child modules can use keywords
  instead of version strings in their dependencies, plugins, and
  parent vectors. Those keywords are mapped to actual version strings
  in this map, allowing you to maintain the versions of your child
  modules' shared dependencies in a single place. Just like with
  `:inherited`, the most immediate ancestors take precedence.
* `:dirs` - Normally, child modules are discovered by searching for
  project.clj files beneath the project's `:root` with a proper
  `:parent` reference, but this vector can override that behavior by
  specifying exactly which directories contain child modules. This
  vector is only required when your module hierarchy doesn't match
  your directory hierarchy, e.g. when a parent module is in a sibling
  directory. Regardless of this option, build order is always
  determined by child module interdependence.

## TODO

* Add an optional `:profiles` key in `:inherited` that indicates which
  parent profiles should be merged when the same profile is active in
  the child. Note `:profiles` and `:active-profiles` on project's
  metadata and expand any composite keys
* Have plugin put `[lein-modules "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` in the `:plugins`
  vector of `:without-profiles` metadata via middeware? Otherwise, the
  pom and jar tasks unmerge the `:default` profiles, and
  versionization doesn't occur. On second thought, it may be better to
  just be explicit and expect every module involved to include the
  plugin.
* Versionization of `:plugins` is potentially a bit of a chicken or
  egg problem -- plugins are loaded before middleware is applied, so
  keyword versions will disappoint pomegranate. Instead, we may need
  to introduce some subtask that spits out versionized project.clj
  files in each child dir.
* Consider replacing the version keyword stuff with a plugin subtask
  that spits out actual project.clj files for child modules, using the
  version strings from the `:versions` map that would then be keyed by
  symbols rather than keywords. The symbols would match the first
  element of the dependency vectors found in `:dependencies`,
  `:plugins`, and `:parent` in the child project maps. We'd want to
  preserve formatting and comments and probably leave `:profiles`
  alone. That could make straight regex replacement tricky.
